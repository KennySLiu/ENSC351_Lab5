To build this, type "make multithread" or "make singlethread". 

Only the multithreaded version will have progress reporting in the form of outputting backtracks every two seconds.

It is recommended that you keep your test files in a nested folder named "test_files". Otherwise the makefile will also make poorly-named files (./test_files)
